**ERROR: (ENCOAX-820):	The OA features are disabled in the current session of Encounter because the oax shared library could not be loaded properly. This could be because your installation was not properly configured. To enable OA features, exit the current session and re-launch Encounter either after fixing your installation by running the Configure Installation phase, or after setting the OA_HOME variable to point to a proper OA installation.
